# Markdown Vim Mode

Syntax highlighting and matching rules for [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

## Installation

If you use [Pathogen](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332)(and you should), do this:

    $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
    $ git clone https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown.git

To install without Pathogen, download the [tarball](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown/archive/master.tar.gz) and do this:

    $ cd ~/.vim
    $ tar --strip=1 -zxf vim-markdown-master.tar.gz
